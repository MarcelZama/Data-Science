# Portfolio                       Artificial Inteligence 

My name is Marcel Zama,
I am a Bachelor's degree graduate from South East Technological University Carlow.
I am passionate about technology and Nature.

Along with my College and Professional career, I worked on many projects on my own time. Projects that I was interested in.
Some of the most interesting projects I have been working on are:

-"Bank Management Software" A project for bank workers that allows them to access and modify data inside the system, and add/delete funds from different accounts.
Also, the workers had an identification number and login and password to access the system, everything was monitored and stored on the database.

-Create a complex data science web app using Python that Collects data automatically from Wikipedia on the world records in sports and creates data tables and graphs.
The project has a very pleasant interface and is easy to use, data is selected by the user and the web app does all the work finding and showing it.

-And many other projects I can not talk about but they were related to Data Science, Game Development, Animation Creation, and Web Development.

More interesting Projects can be found on my Github account.
                                                                              
From my love of technology when I came across AI I was always interested in how they work,
so I did my own research and invested time into creating and explaining how "Image Classification, Natural language processing and Linear Regression" work.

                                                                       
My first project idea was the most popular project, the AI that comes to everyone's mind when they think about Artificial intelligence "Image Classification/Image Recognition".


## Image Classification
![Alt Name](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:3840/1*oB3S5yHHhvougJkPXuc8og.gif)

Image Classification uses Machine Learning algorithms to detect the presence of objects within a picture and classify the picture.
This is the foundation of Computer Vision and Image recognition, It has led to technological breakthroughs in some of the worldâ€™s most important industries, 
such as the automotive, medical, and manufacturing sectors.
Machines do not analyze a picture as a whole, they analyze the picture by vectors and pixel patterns.

#### //Oportunities//
This project would help me understand the importance and power of Artificial intelligence the way it can be used in day-to-day life and the opportunities it has to offer. 

How does it work?
Images are being scanned by the machine which is tough what is what and then by analyzing a lot of pictures it is training itself, 
the more pictures are scanned by the machine the bigger the chances of the machine to recognize the inside of a picture.
The way in which machines analyze images is very specific. 
The different methods try to mimic the way in which the brain and eyes work in order to suggest an optimal analysis performance.

#### //Challenges//
The hardest part of working on this project was to find the perfect images to feed to the AI, some images might create problems because of their Illumination, 
Background In some cases, View-Point Variation, or Scale Variation factors might confuse the AI.

The Data I decided to use was located on a website specified in image datasets.

#### *Libraries Used*
*Tensorflow*

TensorFlow is an open-source machine-learning library developed and maintained by Google. It is designed to facilitate the development and deployment of machine learning models,
particularly deep neural networks. TensorFlow is known for its flexibility, scalability, and extensive community support.

*Numpy*

NumPy, short for Numerical Python, is a fundamental open-source library in Python for numerical and mathematical computations. It provides support for working with large,
multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a wide range of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
NumPy serves as a foundation for numerous scientific and data analysis libraries in the Python ecosystem.

*Keras*

Keras is like a friendly, easy-to-use tool for building and training computer programs that can learn from data. It's particularly useful for creating things 
like image recognition, language understanding, and other smart features.
#### *Technologies Used*

#### *Techniques Used*

#### *Tools Used*
*Python*

Python is a high-level, versatile, and widely used programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.
Python has gained popularity across a wide range of domains, including web development, data science, machine learning, scientific computing, automation, and more. 

*Visual Studio Code*

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a free, open-source, and highly popular source code editor developed by Microsoft.
It is widely used by developers for a variety of programming and development tasks across different platforms.
