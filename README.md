Along with my College and Professional career, I worked on many projects at work and on my own time. Projects that I was interested in.
Some of the most interesting projects I have been working on are:

-"Bank Management Software" A project for bank workers that allows them to access and modify data inside the system, and add/delete funds from different accounts.
Also, the workers had an identification number and login and password to access the system, everything was monitored and stored on the database.

-Create a complex data science web app using Python that Collects data automatically from Wikipedia on the world records in sports and creates data tables and graphs.
The project has a very pleasant interface and is easy to use, data is selected by the user and the web app does all the work finding and showing it.

-And many other projects I can not talk about but they were related to Data Science, Game Development, Animation Creation, and Web Development.

More interesting Projects can be found on my Github account.
                                                                              
From my love of technology when I came across AI I was always interested in how they work,
so I did my own research and invested time into creating and explaining how "Image Classification, Natural language processing and Linear Regression" work.

                                                                       
My first project idea was the most popular project, the AI that comes to everyone's mind when they think about Artificial intelligence "Image Classification/Image Recognition".

Image Classification uses Machine Learning algorithms to detect the presence of objects within a picture and classify the picture.
This is the foundation of Computer Vision and Image recognition, It has led to technological breakthroughs in some of the worldâ€™s most important industries, 
such as the automotive, medical, and manufacturing sectors.
Machines do not analyze a picture as a whole, they analyze the picture by vectors and pixel patterns.

//Oportunities//
This project would help me understand the importance and power of Artificial intelligence the way it can be used in day-to-day life and the opportunities it has to offer. 

How does it work?
Images are being scanned by the machine which is tough what is what and then by analyzing a lot of pictures it is training itself, 
the more pictures are scanned by the machine the bigger the chances of the machine to recognize the inside of a picture.
The way in which machines analyze images is very specific. 
The different methods try to mimic the way in which the brain and eyes work in order to suggest an optimal analysis performance.

//Challenges//
The hardest part of working on this project was to find the perfect images to feed to the AI, some images might create problems because of their Illumination, 
Background In some cases, View-Point Variation, or Scale Variation factors might confuse the AI.
